My name is Kevin O'Connell and I am from Naperville Illinois. I currently attend the University of Iowa with a graduation date of 2024. I am pursuing a major is business analytics &
information systems and a minor is computer science. Some of my experience is working as a camp counselor for the Naperville Park District, being a student assistant at the 
Tippie College of Business, and being a General Intern at LA-CO. I am eager to learn and have always had interest in business analytics & information systems and computer science.
